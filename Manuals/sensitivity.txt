To use the sensitivity script you need to have R installed with the sensitivity package, and also the rpy Python library.

Use the sensitivity script to generate trajectories. Note that the config file has to specify the parameters to vary. Follow the example in Colletotrichumm lupini.

	python sensitivity --config config_file_name --task generate

This creates a trajectory file in the output directory.


To analyse a results file

	python sensitivity.py --config config_file_name --task analyse
	
This will generate a series of images showing the mean effect of varying each parameter and the std. deviation of the effect for each of the summary statistics; proportion of landscape covered, maximum distance, median distance, total population.
