General Model of Biological Invasion

The General Model of Biological Invasion (GMBI) simulates biological spread of organisms across a landscape, 
  over time, through multiple generations.
The model is intended to be able to parameterised to represent a wide range of different organisms.

For more information see the documents in the 'Manuals' folder: 
	- for running the model see the GMBI manual
	- for background explanation see the modsim 2011 conference paper (pdf)
