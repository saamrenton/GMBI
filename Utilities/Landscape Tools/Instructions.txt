Landscape Generator

This script can be used to generate random landscapes. There's a few different types of methods it can use, and it's a bit of a mess. To use it, you need to setup a config file, there's some examples in the Landscape Tools directory.  You run it by using python landscape_generator.py --config config_file_name.
